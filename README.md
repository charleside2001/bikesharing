# Overview of NYC Bikesharing Project
This project was performed to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal using visualizations showing;
 * Length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
 * Number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
 * The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week

## Results

   * Most of the trips taken on NYC CitiBike are less than an hour
   * This provides good times for maintenance and bike repairs
